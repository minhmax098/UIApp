UNITY UI MANAGER

What is this and why should I use it ? 

The UI Manager is a stack-based UI Controller class. It is designed to make pushing and popping screens in Unity simple and intuitive. 

No need to have a hundred different UI prefabs sitting in a scene being toggled on and off.

The UI Manager can instantiate and manage screens on-demand. 

It is a cleaner, more streamlined, and easier to maintain approach to UI development than what Unity provides out of the box.
